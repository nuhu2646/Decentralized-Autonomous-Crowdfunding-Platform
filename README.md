# Decentralized Autonomous Crowdfunding Platform

A blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that ensures transparency and accountability through smart contracts and milestone-based fund releases. This platform empowers creators to raise funds while giving backers more control and visibility over their investments.

## Features

### Smart Contract-Based Project Creation

- Automatic wallet creation and fund management
- Multi-signature functionality for added security
- Transparent fund allocation and distribution rules

### Milestone-Based Fund Release
- Funds are held in escrow and released incrementally based on project milestones
- Smart contracts automatically manage fund distribution
- Real-time tracking of milestone progress and fund allocation
- Protection against misuse through automated compliance checks

### Backer Governance
- Democratic voting system for milestone approval
- Weighted voting based on contribution amount
- Automated vote tallying and result execution
- Dispute resolution mechanism through community consensus

### Social Media Integration
- Automated project updates across multiple platforms
- Social proof and engagement metrics
- Community building tools and features
- Campaign performance analytics

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- ProjectFactory.sol: Handles project creation and initialization
- ProjectFunding.sol: Manages fundraising and fund distribution
- MilestoneVoting.sol: Implements voting mechanism
- TokenRegistry.sol: Manages supported tokens and conversion rates

### Backend (Node.js)
- Express.js server for API endpoints
- Web3.js for blockchain interaction
- MongoDB for off-chain data storage
- JWT-based authentication

### Frontend (React)
- Material-UI components for consistent design
- Web3 integration for wallet connectivity
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility
